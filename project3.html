								<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
								<p>The paper tests for how prior outcomes can influence individual’s 
									perception of risk and the existence of the house money effect. 
									The experiment is conducted over two sessions, analysing how 
									individuals choose between a safe and risky lottery when they 
									are framed in either a one-stage or two-stage gamble format. 
									Testing the hypothesis to determine how prior outcomes can affect 
									risk preferences. This paper finds the existence of the house 
									money effect where the initial endowment is sufficiently large 
									enough to counteract the potential losses.</p>

								<h2><strong>Prediction</strong></h2>
								<p>After receiving a prior gain: The participants may be more risk 
									seeking when they receive a prior gain due to the house money 
									effect. This effect explains how prior gains induce risk-seeking 
									behaviour.  If individuals 
									integrate subsequent losses with prior gains then their 
									perception of losses can be reframed as a reduction in a gain. 
									Therefore mitigating the effect of loss aversion upon the individual 
									. Contrary, individuals may segregate losses from prior 
									results, as they include it in the reference point. As reference 
									points are commonly ignored then the individual’s perception of risk 
									will be determined by there utility associated with the potential 
									gain or loss.</p>

								

								<p>After receiving a prior loss: When experiencing prior losses, even 
									if the losses are segregated from the prior endowment it will still 
									result in a negative outcome, therefore this might suggest that 
									perception for losses with or without a prior negative result may 
									result in the same preferences. There is also a case for participants 
									to become more risk averse as they try to mitigate any further losses. 
									Conversely, participants may become more risk seeking when given a 
									negative endowment in order to try and diminish their final losses, 
									as they try and recover their sunk costs. If there were an opportunity 
									to obtain a result around the reflection point (£0) to avoid losses 
									altogether then according to the break-even effect most individuals 
									would become more risk seeking.
								</p>

								<h2><Strong>Summary</Strong></h2>
								<p>Through conducting and evaluating individual’s perceptions of risk between 
									similar choices under different framing effects, this paper is able to 
									conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the presence of the house money 
									effect. Individuals tend to integrate losses when they receive prior gains that 
									amounts larger than the loss. This integration of the loss leads to the 
									individual perceiving the proposed gamble more favourably (risk seeking) 
									than if the same question was posed to them with the removal of the initial gain. 
									These results are therefore consistent with that of Thaler’s (1990) experiment 
									which uses a between subject design. The ‘pure loss’ section of the experiment 
									is unique to this paper and displays a reverse house money effect suggesting 
									that without the possibility of a gain amount, individuals tend to become more 
									risk averse regardless of the initial endowed amount.</p>
